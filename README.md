# Iris-Species-Classification-ML
#### Classify iris plants into three species in this classic dataset
This is basic End to End Machine Learning application Project for Beginners. 

Data set includes labeled data of lenghts and width of petals and sepals of 3 different species of Iris Flower.
It includes 150 rows and 5 colums.
